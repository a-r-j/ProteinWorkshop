% Protein structure representation learning is the foundation for promising applications in drug discovery, protein design, and function prediction.
% However, there remains a need for a robust, standardised benchmark to track the progress of new and established methods with greater granularity and relevance to downstream applications. 
We introduce \emph{ProteinWorkshop}, a comprehensive benchmark suite for Geometric Graph Neural Networks and protein structure representation learning.
% We provide large-scale pre-training and downstream tasks comprised of both experimental and predicted structures, offering a balanced challenge to representation learning algorithms. 
% These tasks enable the systematic evaluation of the quality of the learned embeddings, the structural and functional relationships captured, and their usefulness in downstream tasks. 
We consider large-scale pre-training and downstream tasks on both experimental and predicted structures to enable the systematic evaluation of the quality of the learned structural representation, the functional relationships captured, and their usefulness in downstream tasks. 
% We benchmark state-of-the-art protein-specific and generic geometric Graph Neural Networks and the extent to which they benefit from different types of pre-training. 
% We find that pre-training consistently improves the performance of both rotation-invariant and equivariant geometric models, and that equivariant models seem to benefit even more from pre-training compared to invariant models.
We find that: (1) large-scale pretraining on AlphaFold-predicted structures and auxiliary tasks consistently improve the performance of both rotation-invariant and equivariant Geometric GNNs, and (2) more expressive equivariant GNNs benefit from pretraining to a greater extent compared to invariant models.

We aim to establish a common ground for the machine learning and computational biology communities to rigorously compare and advance protein structure representation learning. 
% By providing a standardised and rigorous evaluation platform, we expect to accelerate the development of novel methodologies and improve our understanding of protein structures and their functions. 
Our open-source codebase reduces the barrier to entry for working with large protein structure datasets by providing: (1) storage-efficient dataloaders from large-scale predicted structures including AlphaFoldDB and ESM Atlas, as well as (2) utilities for constructing new tasks from the entire PDB.
\emph{ProteinWorkshop} is available at: \href{https://github.com/a-r-j/ProteinWorkshop}{\texttt{github.com/a-r-j/ProteinWorkshop}}.

% The codebase incorporates several engineering contributions which considerably reduces the barrier to entry for pre-training and working with large structure-based datasets. Our benchmark is available at: \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ProteinWorkshop-B8F5}.
