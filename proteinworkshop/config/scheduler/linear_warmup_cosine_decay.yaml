# The unit of the scheduler's step size, could also be 'step'.
# 'epoch' updates the scheduler on epoch end whereas 'step'
# updates it after a optimizer update.

# It is recommended to call step() for LinearWarmupCosineAnnealingLR
# after each iteration as calling it after each epoch will keep the starting
# lr at warmup_start_lr for the first epoch which is 0 in most cases.
